Apply the simple approach to perform foreign exchange analysis

* DataSet Folder:
	+ Use data source as the folder name, and data date as name, e.g. /Forex/2017-04-01.csv
	+ Each folder will have a README.md file to give more detail, and follow markdown.

* Docs Folder:
	+ Use paper publish year as the folder name, and actual paper name as file name, e.g. /1992/The use of technical analysis in the foreign exchange market.pdf
	+ Please use the README file in Docs file to give short statement of each paper, and give actual file location.
	+ We need deal with the *paper source* problem. Can we still use our ANU account to download article? 

* SourceCode Folder:
	+ We will use TensorFlow as main library.
	+ As platform need, we need a Docker platform.
	+ All the relative account username/password will save in a shared google doc as Wiki / or we use Redmine as management platform.

* Current Issues (priority from high to low, and leave name as your task):
	+ Set goal
	+ Get dataSet
	+ Finish platform set up (e.g. Sai)
	+ Choose benchmark approaches
	+ Choose a research approach

* Technique details:
